# Fusion-pMT
Fusion-pMT: A revolutionary T-cell immunogenicity prediction model leveraging state-of-the-art biological sequence modeling.

This repository provides the implementation and inference code for our paper:

"Remodeling Peptide-MHC-TCR Triad Binding as Sequence Fusion for Immunogenicity Prediction"

Authors: Jiahao Ma, Hongzong Li, Jian-Dong Huang, Ye-Fan Hu, Yifan Chen

We introduce Fusion-pMT, a novel model utilizing sequence fusion and a unified encoder enhanced with amino acid physicochemical properties for improved immunogenicity prediction.
Installation
bash

pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy tqdm

Usage
bash

python infer.py --input input.csv

(input.csv should contain peptide, MHC, and TCR sequence data in CSV format.)
Highlights

    Unified encoder integrating physicochemical properties and positional embeddings.
    Sequence-form preserved fusion via Cross Attention.
    Pre-trained on peptide-MHC binding data for better performance.
